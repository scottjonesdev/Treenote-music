Treenote is the IDM / ambient / downtempo electronica solo project of composer and electronic musician Scott Jones. Treenote has released several full length <a href="https://treenotemusic.ca/about.html">albums</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Treenote?sub_confirmation=1" target="blank">YouTube</a> video performances of their music have garnered more than 145,000 views and over 1,100 subscribers. 

Treenote's music amalgamates synthetic tones and textures with emotionally charged melodies and structures and explores themes of existential crisis, isolation, anxiety, heartbreak, connection, comfort and the natural world. 

Scott also plays bass in the goth / punk group <a href="https://creaturesofautumn.bandcamp.com/album/crawl" target="_blank">Creatures of Autumn</a> and the neo soul / R&B group Blinkr.
