Treenote is the IDM / ambient / downtempo / electronica solo project of composer and electronic musician Scott Jones. They have released several full length <a href="https://treenote.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">albums</a> and regularly film their recording process to post on YouTube. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Treenote?sub_confirmation=1" target="blank">YouTube</a> video performances of their music have garnered more than 145,000 views and over 1,100 subscribers. 

Treenote's music amalgamates synthetic tones and textures with emotionally charged melodies and structures, exploring themes of existential crisis, isolation, anxiety, memory, connection, comfort and the natural world. 

Scott also plays bass in the goth / punk group <a href="https://creaturesofautumn.bandcamp.com/album/crawl" target="_blank">Creatures of Autumn</a> and the neo soul / R&B group Blinkr.
