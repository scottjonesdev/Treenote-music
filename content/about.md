Hello, I am a composer and electronic musician from B.C. Canada. I started writing and recording my own music back in 2010 when I bought my fist laptop and synthesizer. 

With my music, I aim to amalgamate synthetic tones and textures with emotionally charged melodies and structures. Sylistically, my music can be described as a mix of ambient, idm, and downtempo electronica.

Some artists that inspire me are Boards of Canada, Dear Euphoria, Midera, and Moby. 

I have released several full length albums and regularly upload new music videos to my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/Treenote?sub_confirmation=1" target="blank">YouTube channel</a>. 

Interested in collaborating or using my music in one of your projects? <a href="mailto:scottjoneselectronica@gmail.com">Get in touch!</a> I would love to hear from you!
